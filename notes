Assumptions, Definitions, and Limitations

Scope
- This analysis focuses exclusively on products sold on **Ulta’s U.S. platform**.
- The dataset was filtered to records where:
  - `website = 'ulta'`
  - `country = 'USA'`
- Products from other retailers and regions were excluded to ensure insights
  are specific and actionable for Ulta’s U.S. market.

Metric Definitions

1) Customer Engagement
- Engagement is proxied by the **number of customer ratings** (`noofratings`).
- A higher number of ratings is interpreted as greater customer interaction,
  visibility, and exposure.

2) Customer Satisfaction
- Satisfaction is proxied by the **average product rating** on a **1–5 scale**.
- Rating values were validated prior to analysis to confirm a consistent scale
  across all products.

Segmentation Thresholds

Engagement Levels
- **No engagement:** `NULL` or `0` ratings  
- **Low engagement:** fewer than `10` ratings  
- **Medium engagement:** `10–50` ratings  
- **High engagement:** more than `50` ratings  

Rating Levels
- **High rating:** `≥ 4.0`  
- **Medium rating:** `3.0–3.9`  
- **Low rating:** `< 3.0`  
- **No rating:** `NULL`  

Thresholds align with common consumer interpretation of product ratings in
beauty e-commerce, where scores above 4.0 typically indicate strong satisfaction.

## Limitations
- Ratings and review counts are used as **proxies** and do not directly measure
  sales, conversion, or revenue.
- Engagement levels may be influenced by product age, marketing exposure, or
  platform visibility rather than intrinsic product quality.
- Results represent a historical snapshot and may change as new reviews are added
  or product assortments evolve.
